# Hypothesis Testing While Loop Python:

## Project Objectives:
* write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.

* Note: the height is measured by the number of fully completed layers - if the builders don't have a sufficient number of blocks and cannot complete the next layer, they finish their work immediately.
